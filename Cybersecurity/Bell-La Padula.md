The Bell-La Padula Model is used to achieve **confidentiality**. 
This model has a few assumptions, such as an organisation's hierarchical structure it is used in, where everyone's responsibilities/roles are well-defined.

The model works by granting access to pieces of data (called objects) on a strictly need to know basis. This model uses the rule "no write down, no read up".

| Policies in this model can be replicated to real-life organisations hierarchies (and vice versa) | Even though a user may not have access to an object, they will know about its existence -- so it's not confidential in that aspect. |
| Simple to implement and understand, and has been proven to be successful.                        | The model relies on a large amount of trust within the organisation.                                                                |

![[Bell LaPadula Model.png]]
The Bell LaPadula Model is popular within organisations such as governmental and military. This is because members of the organisations are presumed to have already gone through a process called vetting.
 **Vetting** is a screening process where applicant's backgrounds are examined to establish the risk they pose to the organisation. Therefore, applicants who are successfully vetted are assumed to be trustworthy - which is where this model fits in.
