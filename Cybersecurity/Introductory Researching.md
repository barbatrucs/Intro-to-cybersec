A good way to conduct research: Start with a question; get an initial understanding of the topic; then look into more advanced aspects as needed. (pivot ?)

## Vulnerabilities Searching

Often in hacking you'll come across software that might be open to exploitation. For example, Content Management Systems (such as Wordpress, FuelCMS, Ghost, etc) are frequently used to make setting up a website easier, and many of these are vulnerable to various attacks. So where would we look if we wanted to exploit specific software?

The answer to that question lies in websites such as:

- [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/)
- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search)
- [CVE Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org/)

NVD keeps track of CVEs (**C**ommon **V**ulnerabilities and **E**xposures) -- whether or not there is an exploit publicly available -- so it's a really good place to look if you're researching vulnerabilities in a specific piece of software. CVEs take the form: CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER  

[ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) tends to be very useful for hackers, as it often actually contains exploits that can be downloaded and used straight out of the box. It tends to be one of the first stops when you encounter software in a CTF or pentest.

If you're inclined towards the CLI on Linux, Kali comes pre-installed with a tool called "searchsploit" which allows you to search ExploitDB from your own machine. This is offline, and works using a downloaded version of the database, meaning that you already have all of the exploits already on your Kali Linux!
