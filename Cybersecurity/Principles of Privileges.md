It is vital to administrate and correctly define the various levels of access to an information technology system individuals require.Â 

The levels of access given to individuals are determined on two primary factors:
- The individual's role/function within the organisation
- The sensitivity of the information being stored on the system

Two key concepts are used to assign and manage the access rights of individuals: 
- **Privileged Identity Management** (PIM) : translate a user's role within an organisation into an access role on a system
- **Privileged Access Management** (or PAM for short) : the management of the privileges a system's access role has. Also encompasses enforcing security policies such as password management, auditing policies and reducing the attack surface a system faces.

What is essential when discussing privilege and access controls is the principle of **least privilege** :
Users should be given the minimum amount of privileges, and only those that are absolutely necessary for them to perform their duties
